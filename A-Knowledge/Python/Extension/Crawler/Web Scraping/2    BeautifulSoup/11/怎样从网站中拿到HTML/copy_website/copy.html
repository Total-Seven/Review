						can finish it.<br><br>Do you wanna go back?<br><br>Back in time, maybe.<br><br>I think I might
						be pregnant.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>Like for real?<br><br>Like for real.<br><br>Well, did you take
						a test?<br><br>No, but I'm late.<br><br>Okay. But it could be something<br>else. You don't know
						for sure.<br><br>I'm supposed to go to<br>the doctor next week.<br><br>Don't suppose<br>you'd
						come with me?<br><br>Me?<br><br>Yeah, of course,<br>if you want. But…<br><br>what about
						Vince?<br><br>He doesn't know and<br>you can't tell him.<br><br>I'm serious. Swear.<br><br>I
						swear.<br><br>I don't know. Like, do I wait?<br><br>And now he says he<br>wants to join the

						gonna think<br>I'm trying to trick him into staying.<br><br>Well…<br><br>would you keep
						it?<br><br>I work part-time as a coat<br>check girl at the casino.<br><br>What do you
						think?<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Hey! You guys gotta see this.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Come
						on.<br><br>Woo!<br><br>- I told you it'd be epic!<br>- Holy shit!<br><br>This is fucking
						crazy!<br><br>I've never seen them from this<br>high, or this close. This is
						insane!<br><br>Jesse, you think I can make it?<br><br>Maybe if you grew wings.<br><br>You heard
						the ranger,<br><br>water's way deeper now.<br><br>Tell me you're<br>fucking joking.<br><br>-
						Vince.<br>- Don't be stupid. You're not jumping.<br><br>Vince, you would<br>never make it,
						okay?<br><br>Yeah, you'd die.<br><br>- Don't do it.<br>- Vince.<br><br>- Vince, stop.<br>-
						Vince!<br><br>- Vince!<br>- No, no, no. Don't do it.<br><br>Woo! Oh, shit!<br><br>All right.

						Always playing games.<br>- He's just messing with us.<br><br>Well, he's an
						asshole.<br><br>Vince! Vince?<br><br>Vince!<br><br>Do you think he went in<br>and the current
						took him?<br><br>- No way he jumped the falls.<br>- Vince!<br><br>He better not be fucking

						shit out of me!<br><br>Not fucking funny, man.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>Oh, my
						God!<br><br>Oh, nasty!<br><br>I think it's recent,<br><br>last night's storm maybe.<br><br>No,
						no, no, no, no. You<br>do not wanna go in there.<br><br>Yeah, we should call the<br>cops or tell
						the ranger.<br><br>I mean, maybe no one even<br>knows this is out here.<br><br>Normally, that's
						what<br>the transponder's for.<br><br>No. No power.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>Em, what are you
						doing?<br><br>Just in case someone asks.<br><br>It's morbid. He's dead.<br><br>Okay,

						reward?<br><br>Motherfucker.<br><br>Is that… cocaine?<br><br>Only one way to know for
						sure.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>- You can't do that.<br>- Why not?<br><br>So many
						fucking reasons that should<br>be obvious to a normal human being.<br><br>Let's all just
						relax,<br>okay? Alex is right.<br><br>We can't touch this.<br><br>Do you have any idea how
						much<br>one of these bricks are worth?<br><br>Enough to put each of<br>us away for a
						decade.<br><br>- Do you see cops?<br>- We're not drug dealers.<br><br>And what about the dead
						body?<br>I mean, that's a human being.<br><br>We'll make an<br>anonymous call
						later.<br><br>Check it! This…<br><br>This could set us up for<br>a real fucking long
						time.<br><br>It could literally<br>change our lives.<br><br>Em, you're not
						actually<br>considering this?<br><br>Not all of us are going<br>away to some fancy
						school.<br><br>School?<br><br>- What's she talking about?<br>- She didn't tell you?<br><br>She's
						leaving you, dude,<br>for some rich-ass college.<br><br>Is this for real?<br><br>No.<br><br>I
						mean, it's not for sure.<br><br>'Cause that's why I didn't tell<br>you. Without the
						scholarship…<br><br>You can afford it now.<br><br>- If we were to do this...<br>- Em!<br><br>Was
						I talking to you?<br><br>How do we sell it?<br><br>Uh, Jesse's got a weed guy, for<br>sure
						there's a connection there.<br><br>- No, leave me outta this.<br>- You work at a
						casino.<br><br>And then there's<br>always Alex's daddy.<br><br>Oh, do you want me to text
						him?<br><br>Or take a sample home<br>for Sunday night dinner?<br><br>You're all crazy!
						I'm<br>going to the cops.<br><br>If you do, I'll tell them he<br>was the one who put us up to
						it.<br><br>- Yeah?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>What happens when he finds out?<br><br>Hey, man, back off,

						Murph. I heard gunshots.<br><br>One of those little fuckers<br>took a pop at me and fucked
						off.<br><br>They know where the plane<br>is. I found a couple bricks.<br><br>Anything from
						Jerry?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>He should've cut them off at<br>the bottom of the logging road by
						now.<br><br>I'm still at the clearing.<br>You want I should go check it out?<br><br>No. I'll
						head down<br>and see what's going on<br><br>as soon as I can see straight.<br><br>Guys, we have

						Valley.<br><br>Fuck.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Ah!<br><br>Climb down, or I<br>start
						taking shots.<br><br>I got more ammo than<br>time. It's your choice.<br><br>Fine. Have it your
						way.<br><br>No, um, all right.<br><br>Don't shoot. I'm<br>coming down, okay?<br><br>Smart
						girl.<br><br>We were just hiking. I swear.<br><br>Bullshit, we know you<br>know where the plane
						is.<br><br>Yes, but we found<br>it by accident.<br><br>We really only came<br>to hike the
						falls.<br><br>All right.<br><br>That's better.<br><br>Now, uh, which one are you?<br><br>- Your
						name?<br>- Alex.<br><br>Okay, Alex.<br><br>You're gonna take me to<br>that plane, and in
						return,<br><br>I'm gonna let you<br>live. You understand?<br><br>I need you to say it out
						loud.<br><br>I'll take you to the crash site.<br>Just, please don't hurt me.<br><br>That's up to
						you.<br><br>How far is it?<br><br>Uh, it's close.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Start
						walking.<br><br>Murph, they killed Jerry.<br><br>- Looks like they ran off the road.<br>-
						Jesus.<br><br>All right, I'm here<br>with one of the girls.<br><br>- She's taking me to the
						plane now.<br>- Good.<br><br>Radio me your location<br>as soon as you're there,<br><br>and no
						loose ends, you hear me?<br><br>Cutter, they're<br>just kids, you know?<br><br>Well, they saw
						our faces<br>so they don't leave this forest.<br><br>Is that clear?<br><br>Murph?<br><br>Yeah.
						Copy that. Murph out.<br><br>Move.<br><br>I don't see a plane.<br><br>Hey! Better not
						be<br>fucking around here.<br><br>Down there. It's<br>around a sandbank.<br><br>I think you're
						lying!<br><br>I swear. That's how we found<br>it. I don't know another way.<br><br>Well, how do
						you get down?<br><br>Is there a path?<br><br>What the fuck!<br><br>Cutter, that crazy
						bitch<br>just jumped the falls.<br><br>Are you at the plane?<br><br>No, no, no, she was
						gonna<br>take me to the plane,<br><br>and then she jumped<br>the fucking falls!<br><br>How 'bout
						you<br>get the fuck after her?<br><br>Get after her.<br><br>Get after
						her.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Fuck that! Hell no!<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Hey! You trying to<br>get
						yourself killed?<br><br>You gonna shoot me?<br><br>I don't see a plane!<br><br>Do
						it!<br><br>Fuck!<br><br>Cutter.<br><br>The current's too strong.<br>She must have
						drowned.<br><br>What about the plane?<br><br>Still no sign of it.<br><br>Well, I've got<br>the
						other two, so…<br><br>we'll know soon enough.<br><br>Copy that.<br><br>They aren't
						going…<br><br>anywhere.<br><br>Need a little haircut?<br><br>Just one or two?<br><br>What about
						you, huh?<br><br>Just a hair or two.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>- You're alive.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>No
						thanks to any of you.<br><br>But we looked for you.<br><br>Hmm, I bet you looked<br>real fucking
						hard.<br><br>Where's Em And Jesse?<br><br>Jesse hit that<br>asshole with a rock,<br><br>which
						only pissed him<br>off, so we took off.<br><br>Got real far I see.<br><br>Jesse and Em are
						hiding down the<br>road, but I went back to get the map<br><br>and I ran into<br>another one of
						them.<br><br>Oh, the map's gone, along<br>with everything else.<br><br>How'd you get
						away?<br><br>I jumped the falls.<br><br>Like for real?<br><br>- Like, like from the top
						top?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You're fucking crazy.<br><br>Oh. Ow. Fuck.<br><br>Look, they're
						probably<br>looking for me, so…<br><br>Oh. You know, a please or<br>a thank you would be
						nice.<br><br>- You're such a dick.<br>- Love you, too.<br><br>Jesus!<br><br>A little warning
						next time.<br><br>Next dead body, promise.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>That should
						hold.<br><br>What are you doing?<br>Give me the keys.<br><br>Dream on, gimp.<br><br>- I'm
						sorry.<br>- You're sorry?<br><br>What the fuck did you<br>think was gonna happen?<br><br>I saw
						an opportunity<br>and I took it.<br><br>An opportunity for free drugs?<br><br>World doesn't work
						like that.<br><br>Yeah, well, my world<br>doesn't work your way.<br><br>At least you
						have<br>options. Me, I'm…<br><br>I'm another fucking Danny<br>Hagel waiting to
						happen.<br><br>That's not true.<br><br>- You really need to talk to Em.<br>- About
						what?<br><br>Whoa. Look.<br><br>Oh, fuck.<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Thank God you're here.<br>There are
						these guys.<br><br>They have guns. They're after us.<br>They're drug runners or
						something.<br><br>Whoa, slow down. Slowly.<br><br>We heard the gunshots.<br><br>We've already
						got<br>patrols in the area.<br><br>You're safe.<br><br>What about Em and Jesse?<br><br>Yeah,
						they're our friends.<br><br>Emily and Jesse. Yeah, we know.<br><br>We picked them up a while
						back.<br><br>Yeah, we got them at<br>the ranger station.<br><br>They're getting all patched
						up.<br><br>Come on. I'll take you to them.<br><br>I think you need a<br>call for back
						up,<br><br>'cause these guys are killers.<br><br>We saw three of them,<br>but there could be
						more.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Yeah, I got the other two.<br><br>I'll contact you
						from<br>the ranger station. Over.<br><br>Copy that. Over.<br><br>You think you'd be able
						to…<br><br>describe these guys<br>if you saw 'em?<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>One guy had some,
						uh...<br><br>Come on, rise and shine.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>You ready to
						talk?<br><br>Where am I?<br><br>You're alive.<br><br>Whether you stay that<br>way is up to
						you.<br><br>My friends?<br><br>Where are my friends?<br><br>Cutter, missy here<br>wants proof of
						life.<br><br>Copy that.<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Stop!<br><br>Where's my plane,
						Alex?<br><br>Fine.<br><br>- I'll tell you.<br>- No, you'll take me.<br><br>And this time,
						we'll<br>stay on dry land.<br><br>You make one sound,<br><br>I'll take one life.<br><br>We
						clear?<br><br>Crystal.<br><br>We're looking<br>at a lot of mudslides up there.<br><br>If you're
						coming<br>up from the north,<br><br>I'd say you're looking<br>at a lot of detours.<br><br>And
						it's best to stay clear.<br><br>Hi there.<br><br>If you're looking for a day<br>pass, you're
						outta luck.<br><br>Park's closed for maintenance on<br>account of last night's storm.<br><br>I'm
						not here to sightsee.<br><br>Well, then, what<br>can I help you with?<br><br>I'm looking for
						Skip.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Don't know no Skip.<br><br>Something I can help you
						with?<br><br>Sir?<br><br>I was told I'd find Skip<br>at the ranger station.<br><br>Well, like I
						said,<br><br>nobody's been by all day on<br>account of last night's storm.<br><br>Trails are
						pretty washed out.<br><br>- Is that right?<br>- Afraid so.<br><br>But if your friend<br>Skip
						shows up,<br><br>I'd be happy to<br>give her a message.<br><br>I never said Skip was a
						her.<br><br>- Lucky guess.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Hands on the counter, now.<br><br>Okay, we don't
						keep<br>any money here.<br><br>Shut the hell up.<br><br>You bitch.<br><br>That's on
						you.<br><br>Nolan, come in.<br><br>Been waiting<br>on you. What's the hold up?<br><br>Bit of a
						complication.<br><br>You stay put. I'm coming to you.<br><br>You had to be a rebel,
						huh?<br><br>We're going for a ride.<br><br>Keep moving.<br><br>You're so fucked.<br><br>Oh, is
						that so?<br><br>When my dad finds out<br>what you guys are doing,<br><br>he's gonna cut you
						up<br>into tiny little pieces.<br><br>Mm, that's precious. Your<br>daddy can't save you
						now.<br><br>You just killed a Saint.<br><br>Now you've one of<br>their kids hostage.<br><br>I'm
						talking to a dead woman.<br><br>Nice bluff, kid.<br><br>I'll take my chances.<br><br>Get
						in.<br><br>Get in!<br><br>Nolan, come in.<br><br>Change of plans.<br><br>A Saint showed
						up.<br><br>Had to do what I had to do.<br><br>- Jesus Christ.<br>- Couldn't be helped.<br><br>-
						You had to?<br>- Now, this changes things.<br><br>I'd say that's a major<br>fucking
						understatement.<br><br>We can still<br>get ahead of this.<br><br>Gotta move fast<br>before more
						show up.<br><br>I'm on my way to the plane now.<br><br>I'll radio a location<br>when I'm
						there.<br><br>And what about the kids?<br><br>You know, just keep<br>them
						breathing.<br><br>After that, you can<br>give them to Cutter.<br><br>Man, this is fucked
						up.<br><br>There's a way you can<br>still get out of this.<br><br>You take me to that
						plane,<br><br>I'll let you go.<br><br>Simple as that.<br><br>Maybe I'll even let your<br>little
						boyfriend keep his leg.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>This can hurt… just<br>as well as kill.<br><br>Do you
						understand me?<br><br>Good.<br><br>Now, where are we headed?<br><br>Just around the
						bend.<br><br>See how easy that was?<br><br>Shit!<br><br>I'm gonna fucking kill you!<br><br>Big
						mistake!<br><br>I'm gonna make it real slow<br>and painful for your friends.<br><br>First, I'll
						do missy.<br><br>And then I'll set your<br>boyfriend on fire,<br><br>just a little bit at a
						time…<br><br>until the forest fills with<br>the smell of burning flesh.<br><br>Tune in if you
						don't believe me.<br><br>It's up to you.<br><br>Cutter, don't lay a finger on those
						brats<br>'til you hear from me, are you clear?<br><br>Wouldn't dream of it.<br><br>- Leave him
						alone!<br>- What's the matter with you?<br><br>You feeling<br>left out, huh?<br><br>- I'm
						pregnant!<br>- Hey!<br><br>You heard what Skip said.<br><br>They're just
						kids.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>You're right.<br>Little kiddies, huh?<br><br>This one smashed my
						fucking<br>head in with a fucking rock!<br><br>Hey. Hey.<br><br>You take orders from
						me,<br><br>not the other way around.<br><br>You understand?<br><br>You get that?<br><br>Yeah, I
						gotcha.<br><br>Good.<br><br>Hey, guys,<br><br>I'm feeling generous today.<br><br>So, tell you
						what.<br><br>I'm gonna let one of you…<br><br>…go free.<br><br>And the best part is,<br><br>you
						get to decide…<br><br>who it is.<br><br>Or I can decide for you.<br><br>What do you
						say?<br><br>Who's it gonna be?<br><br>Who's it gonna be?<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>Uh
						oh.<br><br>Cock it.<br><br>Em, he's lying. He's<br>not gonna let you go.<br><br>I'm
						sorry.<br><br>No.<br><br>- I'm sorry.<br>- No.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Please. Please,
						don't!<br><br>Oh.<br><br>At least we know which<br>one of you has balls.<br><br>How
						about<br>another round, huh?<br><br>I don't know about you, but<br>I could do this all
						day.<br><br>Here. Take it again.<br><br>Quit fucking around, Cutter.<br><br>If the little
						bitch<br>doesn't show up,<br><br>we're gonna need<br>one of these two.<br><br>We're losing
						daylight here.<br><br>I'm just saying.<br><br>Yeah, well, this isn't over.<br><br>And I'm not
						leaving<br>empty handed.<br><br>My money's on<br>that old mine dump, huh?<br><br>I say we send
						Murph<br>out there again.<br><br>There's ten miles of bush-whacking<br>between here and the
						dump.<br><br>Fuck this.<br><br>The Saints are on<br>the way, it's getting dark.<br><br>Either
						she takes us to<br>the plane, or we're done.<br><br>We're done when<br>I say we're

						huh?<br><br>Fuck. No.<br><br>Oh, fuck.<br><br>Maybe then<br>she'll talk, yeah?<br><br>No. No,
